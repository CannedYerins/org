* <2015-01-27 Tue> Definition
Seen as attempting to replicate human sight.  Falls short in most
cases, but exceeds in certain others.  Vision for measurement,
recognition and labeling, face detection and recognition, individual
identification and biometrics, category recognition, search by image,
face morphing/image modification, gaming.
* Raw Image Data
Damn Big Array.  RGB values, grayscale values, image resolution.
Extract features/key points!  Use features to describe viewpoint
invariant part of image.  
* Stewart's application!
Animal database in Kenya.  Recognizing and tracking animals.  Counting
zebras oh god.
* DONE Homework
Install cv2

* <2015-01-30 Fri> Image color spaces

** color cameras and RGB
Unlikely that average cameras have RBG pixel values.  More likely
(Bayer pattern): 
G B G B G B . . .  
R G R G R G . . .  
G B G B G B . . .

This pattern is then DeBayered (interpolation/averaging):
RGB | RGB . . .

** RGB is not perceptually uniform
Same offset to different values = different offset perception. 

** Converting RGB to grayscale
Humans are most sensitive to green, so coefficient on green is 
highest when converting.

* <2015-02-03 Tue> Linear algebra
** Eigenfaces
An old an quick method to take the average of a set of images; 
considered outdated but fundamentally related to linear algebra.
* <2015-02-06 Fri> Lines oh baby
** Slope-intercept 
Has problems because vertical lines can't be represented, also the 
range of $m$ for the first 45 degrees is 0..1, the remainder is 
1..infinity.
** Distance
We use squared distance because it's differentiable and solvable 
in closed form.
* <2015-02-13 Fri> Camera matrix
** extrinsic parameters
Rotated and translated in world coordinates: p in world coordinates, 
p' in camera coordinates, with rotation R and translation t.  
$p = Rp' + t$.  
** intrinsic parameters
u and v should have + signs, not - signs
* image processing
** averaging as convolution
h(k,l) = 1/25 if |k| \leq 2 and |l| \leq 2 else 0
* <2015-04-15 Wed> find homography
** Load 2 images
** load & calculate sift features
** get matches
** filter by ratio test
** build homography from 4 random points called H_hat
Take eigenvalues of (A.T dot A), pick eigenvector corresponding to smallest
eigenvalue, normalize by last element, reshape into 3x3 matrix.
** using threshold, find inliers for H_hat
** find H with max # of inliers and set of inliers
** build a formal H with all points in biggest inliers set
Rejection criteria: distance error of all inliers and outliers compared to 
num keypoints * tau
